# Git workflow, branches and commit history

[Overview](../README.md) | [Report](../REPORT.md) | [Git evidence](EVIDENCE.md#q2-version-control)

## Demonstrated sequence

This section reconstructs the workflow already completed. It is not a script to rerun over the existing repository.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir devops-lab1
cd devops-lab1
git init
git branch -M main
# app.py and README.md were created here.
git add app.py README.md
git commit -m "Initial Python application setup"

git switch -c feature-tests
# test_app.py, requirements.txt and .gitignore were added here.
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -v
git add .gitignore requirements.txt test_app.py
git commit -m "Add unit tests with pytest"
git switch main
git merge feature-tests

git switch -c docs-update
# The CI/CD stages section was added to README.md here.
git add README.md
git commit -m "Document CI/CD pipeline stages"
git switch main
git merge docs-update
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

The repository's `.gitignore` excludes the virtual environment, Python caches and compiled bytecode. Staging named files avoids accidentally including generated deployment output or credentials.

## GitHub remote and authentication

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ArghyadiptaGoswami4259/devops-lab1.git
git remote -v
git push -u origin main
```

The practical used GitHub CLI browser authentication after the initial push requested credentials. The [authentication screenshot](evidence/screenshots/ss18-github-auth.png) masks the token. Never commit the local GitHub CLI credential file or paste an access token into the repository URL.

The local `gh` authentication belongs to the developer's Linux user. It is separate from Jenkins's service-account configuration. The public repository can be read without transferring the developer's authentication to Jenkins.

The first three short hashes are also visible in the local history screenshots. The review baseline is commit `50715110d0a0c622566ec0175ddf0d73c4560bd6`. Later documentation commits should be added normally, not used to replace this history.

## Why the merge graph is linear

The feature merge output explicitly says `Fast-forward`. This records a valid merge by advancing `main` to the feature branch's tip. It does not produce a two-parent merge commit. Do not fabricate a non-linear graph or redo the exercise simply to make the history look more complex.

## Local branches versus GitHub branches

The captured local history includes `feature-tests` and `docs-update`. The GitHub branch listing at the review baseline contains only `main`, because `git push -u origin main` does not publish every local branch.

Publishing the already-existing feature branches is optional but makes them visible to a GitHub-only evaluator:

```bash
cd ~/devops-lab1
git branch --list
# Run only if both names above still exist locally:
git push origin feature-tests docs-update
```

There is no need to delete, recreate, force-push or rewrite branches. The existing screenshots already demonstrate branch creation and the merge operation.

## Capture current history for the submission

The provided helper records fresh Git output from the real repository:

```bash
cd ~/devops-lab1
bash scripts/capture-evidence.sh
```

It does not change Git identity or create commits. Review the generated logs before staging them. The captured history is the state before the subsequent evidence-upload commit; that ordering is normal.
